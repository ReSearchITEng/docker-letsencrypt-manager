# docker-letsencrypt-manager
A docker image allowing you to manage your domains and certificates and automatically renews them. It is based on the [official letsencrypt docker image](https://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html#running-with-docker). It uses the [ACME webroot method](http://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html#webroot) to perform domain validation, allowing zero-downtime certificate renewals.

## Installation

The most simple way to install letsencrypt-manager is by using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). Letsencrypt-manager already comes with a ready-to-use docker-compose configuration which you can easily adapt to your needs.

### Setting up letsencrypt-manager on a new machine

If you install a machine which should be able to request and automatically renew certificates, you need to first install **letsencrypt-manager** on it. This is easily done by cloning the Git repository and optionally adapting the configuration.

1. Clone letsencrypt-manager
```
# cd /opt/ && git clone https://github.com/bringnow/docker-letsencrypt-manager.git && cd docker-letsencrypt-manager
```
3. Add an alias for letsencrypt-manager (optional):
```
# echo alias letsencrypt-manager=\'/opt/docker-letsencrypt-manager/letsencrypt-manager\' >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
```
4. The command `letsencrypt-manager` is now ready for usage. Type `letsencrypt-manager help` for a list of available commands:
```
root@example.com:~ # letsencrypt-manager help
Checking for newer docker image (pass --no-update-check to suppress this behavior)

Status: Downloaded newer image for bringnow/letsencrypt-manager:latest
Available commands:

help              - Show this help
list              - List configured domains and their certificate's status
add               - Add a new domain and create a certificate for it
renew             - Renew the certificate for an existing domain. Allows to add additional domain names.
remove            - Remove and existing domain and its certificate
cron-auto-renewal - Run the cron job automatically renewing all certificates
auto-renew        - Try to automatically renew all installed certificates
```

As you can see, the `letsencrypt-manager` helper script automatically downloads the latest version of the docker image. If you want to disable updating on every execution, just pass the `--no-update-check` flag. For example `letsencrypt-manager --no-update-check help`.

You can now proceed with the following sections.

### Custom configuration (optional)

Just change the environment variables in file `config.env`. Currently there are only two variables:

* `LE_EMAIL`: Set the email-address used by letsencrypt. If not set, letsencrypt will ask for it interactively when requesting a certificate. (optional)
* `LE_RSA_KEY_SIZE`: Set the RSA key size used by letsencrypt (optional).

The `docker-compose.yml` config file already defines some docker host volumes. Of course you can change them easily. See [Compose file reference](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#volumes-volume-driver) for syntax details. *Notice that you need to change them twice, for the services cli and cron!*

#### Volumes

* `/etc/letsencrypt`: The configuration directory of the letsencrypt client.
* `/var/lib/letsencrypt`: The working directory of the letsencrypt client.
* `/var/acme-webroot`: This is the directory where letsencrypt puts data for [ACME webroot validation](http://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html#webroot).

### Preparing your webserver

The webserver of your choice must expose the configured webroot folder of the host (see the [Let's Encrypt Documentation](http://letsencrypt.readthedocs.org/en/latest/using.html#webroot) for details).

If you want to use [haproxy](http://www.haproxy.org/) we recommend to use our [haproxy-letsencrypt Docker image](https://github.com/bringnow/docker-haproxy-letsencrypt) for zero-downtime renewal and automatic reload on configuration/certificate changes.

If you want to use [nginx](http://nginx.org/) we recommend to use our [nginx-letsencrypt Docker image](https://github.com/bringnow/docker-nginx-letsencrypt) for zero-downtime renewal and automatic reload on configuration/certificate changes.

## Usage

### Show installed domains/certificates

You can show the installed certificates by simply calling `letsencrypt-manager list`:

```
root@example.com:/opt/docker-letsencrypt-manager # letsencrypt-manager list
Checking for newer docker image (pass --no-update-check to suppress this behavior)
Pulling cli (bringnow/letsencrypt-manager:latest)...

Status: Image is up to date for bringnow/letsencrypt-manager:latest
DOMAINNAME                    ALTERNATIVE DOMAINNAMES                        VALID UNTIL               REMAINING DAYS
example.come                  example.com example.de                         Feb 14 12:52:00 2016 GMT  15
```

The helper script will automatically update the docker image of letsencrypt-manager. If you want to skip this update just pass the flag `--no-update-check`.

The `list` command shows a table with one row per certificate and four columns:

1. The **main domain name** of the certificate.
2. The space-separated list of **alternative domain names** for the certificate.
3. The **absolute expiry date** of the certificate.
4. The **relative expiry date** of the certificate in days.

### Adding a new domain/certificate

1. Ensure the DNS configuration for the new domains is properly setup to point to the machine.
2. If this is the first server (no previous certificates), ensure you have a server running on 80 what is pointing to /var/acme-webroot/. If you don't, you can run this command:
``` docker run --name temp-nginx -v /var/acme-webroot/:/usr/share/nginx/html:ro -p 80:80 -d nginx ```
3. Execute `letsencrypt-manager add <main domain name> [alternative domain names]...`
4. If at step 2 you have created a temporary server, now it's time to remove it:
```docker rm -f temp-nginx ```

### Configuring auto-renewal of certificates

Starting the cronjob which automatically renews all installed certificate is actually quite simple, just execute the `update-cron.sh` script to update the docker image and (re)-creating the service:

```
root@example.com:/opt/docker-letsencrypt-manager # ./update-cron.sh

Status: Image is up to date for bringnow/letsencrypt-manager:latest
Creating dockerletsencryptmanager_cron_1...
```

The cronjob will check every day if any of the installed certificates expires in less than 4 weeks and will try to renew them. That was simple, wasn't it?

If you want to manually start the auto-renewal, just call `letsencrypt-manager auto-renew`.

### Modify/renew an existing certificate

To modify the list of alternative domain names and/or manually renew a certificate you can run the `renew` command:

```
letsencrypt-manager renew <domain name> [alternative domain names]...
```

### Removing a domain/certificate

Removing an domain from the host can be achieved by executing `letsencrypt-manager rm <domainname>`. This will remove all certificates and also auto-renewal configuration for this domain.

### Sync certificates, keys and configuration to a Git repository

If you want to backup the private keys and certificates (what you should do!) we recommend [docker-git-sync](https://github.com/bringnow/docker-git-sync). It will periodically listen for changes in the */etc/letsencrypt* folder and commit & push any changes to a Git repository of your choice. **Make sure to keep this Git repository in a safe place!**

## Troubleshooting

### tail: unrecognized file system type 0x794c7630 for '/var/log/cron.log

Please update your letsencrypt-manager docker image and recreate your container(s), see [bug report](https://github.com/bringnow/docker-letsencrypt-manager/issues/2).
